Don't know where to begin?  This bootcamp is intended for employees who know their subject-matter, but don't know how to train another adult!  Most participants provide training to other employees or students as a small part of their job. L\u0026OD is providing a research-based background in adult learning principles and well established best practices.  These two topics combined with your knowledge and skills will provide the learner with a foundation for training adults.

Guided by the expertise of local Latinx artists, this ofrenda serves as a powerful homage to the rich cultural heritage and sacred traditions of the Day of the Dead.\n\nSeven artists from the Inter-Latin American Artist Collective (ILAAC) have created oversized calaveras, colorfully painted skulls traditionally used to decorate ofrendas, and transformed the space with traditional elements. Surrounding the gallery, visitors will find bright yellow and gold marigolds made of tissue paper to guide spirits to the ofrenda, papel picado (perforated paper) that symbolizes the union between life and death, and more.\n\nThis installation reminds visitors of the importance of honoring those who came before us, while fostering a sense of togetherness and understanding across cultural boundaries.\n\n###\nHow to Contribute:\nThe Ofrenda is open to the general public, and all visitors are invited to contribute to this meaningful project by adding photographs and objects that are representative of a departed loved one. Please note that we are unable to return offerings to the original owner, so please do not leave anything valuable or original. While a loved one's favorite food is traditional to offer during Day of the Dead, we ask that you leave only non-perishable food items, and no liquids at all. We encourage you to substitute perishable foods for photos, drawings, labels or other creative alternatives.\n\nJoin us at the Duke University Rubenstein Arts Center Gallery as we come together to celebrate, create, and pay homage to the Day of the Dead. Your participation will help weave a tapestry of memories and stories that transcend time, showcasing the enduring significance of this cherished tradition.","status":"CONFIRMED","sponsor":"Duke Arts","co_sponsors":null,"location":{"address":"Rubenstein Arts Center Gallery | 2nd Floor","link":"https://dukearts.org/venues/rubenstein-arts-center-gallery/"},"contact":{"name":"Yanez, Yesenia","email":"yesenia.yanez@duke.edu","phone":"984-569-0680"},"categories":["Visual and Creative Arts","Central America focus","Exhibit"],"link":"https://calendar.duke.edu/show?fq=id:CAL-8a018d0d-8b5366bc-018b-5d2a688b-00004544demobedework@mysite.edu","event_url":"https://arts.duke.edu/news/announcing-dia-de-los-muertos-ofrenda-at-the-rubenstein-arts-center/","submitted_by":["ymy"],"image":"https://calendar.duke.edu/images//2023/20231018/c89b749002e65bd1ac44c01dee2178e7-CR-Day of the Dead Graphics 530 x 353 1_20231023033038PM.png","image_alt_text":"Graphic of 3 sugar skulls"},{"id":"CAL-2c918083-7bf1eaed-017c-150f18e4-0000595cdemobedework@mysite.edu_20231019T040000Z","start_timestamp":"2023-10-19T04:00:00Z","end_timestamp":"2024-07-18T04:00:00Z","summary":"Doing Good Employee Giving Campaign","description":"Doing Good, Duke's annual employee giving campaign, encourages Duke employees to donate to five community-identified need categories, including the United Way of the Greater Triangle.

It will include 9-10 speakers discussing their current theoretical challenges, and their attempts to find new approaches to burning questions. \n\nAs we near a second generation of thought, already rooted in the current century, the different literary departments' theoretical courses are still heavily reliant on 20th century theory. Against the backdrop of political upheavals, climate crisis, and the attempts to appropriate Judaism in Israel in the name of nationalistic ideas and forces, we ask: What are the urgent tasks of the study of Hebrew Literature? What can contemporary Hebrew literature scholarship contribute to these ongoing discussions? What are the current theoretical approaches that could be of use to us?\n\nIn this conference, we aim to discuss the possibilities and \"embarrassments\" of our particular point in time. This point in time being, both on a meta level: our own in-between career stage as post-docs and new PhDs, but also of this stage in history of Hebrew Literature, the current reality that might shape the thought of Hebrew literature, our field, in the near future. \n\nA keynote lecture by Saskia Ziolkowski, Associate Professor of Romance Studies at Duke University will open the conference.\n\nThe conference includes participants from the United States, as well as participants arriving from Israel and Europe and is comprised of emerging scholars.\n\nDiscussions will be held alternately in both Hebrew and English.\nהוֹ מְצִיאוּת, רוּחַ רְפָאִים קְטַנָּה שֶׁלִּי, פִּצְפּוֹנִית שֶׁלִּי, יָבוֹא\nיוֹם שֶׁאֲנָשִׁים יַבְחִינוּ בָּךְ. יָשִׂימוּ לֵב אֵלַיִךְ. יְדַבְּרוּ עָלַיִךְ.\nיִמְחֲאוּ לָךְ כַּפַּיִם. יָרִיעוּ לָךְ. יִרְצוּ לְהִתְקָרֵב אֵלַיִךְ. לָגַעַת\nבָּךְ. לָחוּשׁ אוֹתָךְ. לִשְׁמֹר עָלַיִךְ. לְשׂוֹחֵחַ אִתָּךְ. לְהָבִין. אַחַר\nכָּךְ תַּחְלִיטִי\n \n(חדוה הרכבי)\n \nAh Reality, my little ghost, my teeny-tiny one, the day will come \nwhen people will notice you.

The young, faith-tested Father Carras (Jason Miller) and elderly archeologist Father Lankester Merrin (Max Von Sydow) prepare for an exorcism to vanquish the unholy evil.\n\nA timeless - often deemed cursed - horror masterpiece, the late, great William Friedkin's seminal adaptation of William Peter Blatty's \"The Exorcist\" remains every bit as chilling now as its first release in 1973.","status":"CONFIRMED","sponsor":"Cinematic Arts","co_sponsors":null,"location":{"address":"Rubenstein Arts Center, Film Theater","link":"https://maps.duke.edu/?focus=351"},"contact":{"name":"Okazaki, Hank","email":"hokazak@duke.edu"},"categories":["Movie/Film"],"link":"https://calendar.duke.edu/show?fq=id:CAL-8a018d0d-8b5366bc-018b-776e3438-0000363bdemobedework@mysite.edu","event_url":"https://cinematicarts.duke.edu/screensociety/screenings/rescheduled-exorcist-directors-cut-william-friedkin-1973","submitted_by":["sab141"],"image":"https://calendar.duke.edu/images//2023/20231029/50bf6491e0f7e6ab3a2e83f63152319a-CR-TheExorcist_20231028055903PM.jpg","image_alt_text":"Still from The Exorcist"},{"id":"CAL-8a028ad1-899cba17-0189-d0c25bd4-000014a0demobedework@mysite.edu_20231030T000000Z","start_timestamp":"2023-10-30T00:00:00Z","end_timestamp":"2023-10-30T01:00:00Z","summary":"Catholic Mass in Duke Chapel","description":"Catholic Mass in Duke Chapel.

David Britt (UC Davis)\nTo learn more about the Britt lab's work, please visit their research page: http://brittepr.ucdavis.edu/ \n\n\nEPR Studies of the Enzymatic Synthesis of the Organometallic H-Cluster of [FeFe] Hydrogenase\n\nThe [FeFe] hydrogenase enzymes are well suited to H2 formation, producing up to 10000 H2 molecules per second, and have therefore generated much interest for renewable energy applications.  The H-cluster consists of a binuclear [2Fe]H subcluster which is linked via a bridging cysteine to a [4Fe-4S]H cluster. This [2Fe]H subcluster contains the organometallic elements of the H-cluster:  the two irons each have a CO and a CN- terminal ligand and are bridged by a third CO and a unique SCH2NHCH2S azadithiolate (adt) moiety. The H+ and H2 substrates are proposed to bind to and react at this [2Fe]H unit. In addition to the relative rarity of enzymes carrying out organometallic reactions, biosynthesis of the H-cluster poises some specific challenges. Of course, free CO and CN- molecules are toxic. In addition, the bridging adt moiety is known to be unstable in solution. The H-cluster biosynthesis is performed by a set of three \"maturase\" proteins, HydE, HydF, and HydG, each containing Fe-S clusters. Two of these, HydE and HydG, are members of the radical SAM superfamily of enzymes, while HydF is a GTPase. Our approach to developing a viable mechanistic proposal for H-cluster synthesis includes chemical biology techniques such as cell free synthesis, isotope sensitive spectroscopy such as electron paramagnetic resonance, and the use of synthetic clusters that can serve as functional substitutes for enzyme intermediates.\n\nHosted by David Beratan","status":"CONFIRMED","sponsor":"Chemistry","co_sponsors":null,"location":{"address":"French Family Science Center 2237","link":"https://maps.duke.edu/?focus=33"},"contact":{"name":"Chem Admin Office","email":"chem-office@duke.edu"},"categories":["Natural Sciences","Lecture/Talk"],"link":"https://calendar.duke.edu/show?fq=id:CAL-8a02906b-8a0a73d8-018a-386d6907-00006a79demobedework@mysite.edu","event_url":null,"submitted_by":["lao26"],"presenter":"R.

The module is designed for an introductory CS or data structures course. The demonstration does not involve programming but assumes students have programming experience in at least one programming language. We will begin with a real-world application of hash tables, then explain what hash tables are and their importance by\ncontrasting hashing to other alternatives. We will then introduce the concept of hash function and describe the goals and challenges of designing a good hash function. We will talk about collisions and possible approaches to resolving collisions. The lecture will also involve multiple active learning exercises to demonstrate how students can interleave between lecture and in-class activities to continue learning outside of the class.\n\nIn the second part of the talk, I will talk about my research mentorship experience with undergraduate students. The talk will highlight my ongoing work with student researchers on interdisciplinary research projects centered around socially beneficial applications leading to research articles in natural science and behavioral science domains. I will conclude with my future vision to design courses, mentor undergraduate research, and organize outreach events to improve the student learning experience and to make computing education accessible as a strategy to promote diversity.\n\nSPEAKER BIO\nTahiya Chowdhury is a Postdoctoral Research Fellow at the Davis Institute for Artificial Intelligence and a visiting faculty member of the Department of Computer Science at Colby College.

The Reverend Dr. Luka Ilic, Reformation Historian and Theologian, and Pastor in the Evangelical-Lutheran Church of Württemberg (Balzheim), Germany  will be the speaker.\n\nIt is well documented that Martin Luther found it important to spend time with his colleagues, students, and those who supported the Reformation, listening to their concerns and giving spiritual advice. Being open about his own struggles and providing encouragement from the Word to those who experienced uncertainty and doubt about their faith made a profound difference in many people's lives. \n\nUrbanus Rhegius and Matthias Flacius Illyricus were among the Reformers who experienced life-changing pastoral care from Luther. \"Father Luther\" helped convert both to a deeper embrace of the Protestant faith and its cruciform understanding of the spiritual life. They, in turn, went on to shape the pastoral care that so defined the Protestant Reformation. This pastoral care still has much wisdom to offer the care of souls in contemporary church and society.\n\nThis event is co-sponsored by the Duke Center for Medieval and Renaissance Studies, the Duke Divinity School Historical Division, and Duke Lutherans.

Hibernation was first documented in 350 BCE by Aristotle, who noted that some creatures give up eating and drinking in winter while concealing themselves in a \"sleep-like\" state for many months. Hibernation employs a collection of flexible physiological adaptations that allow animals to thrive in inhospitable environments, where they experience thermal challenges and scarcity of food and water for extended periods of time. Almost all mammalian orders include hibernators, suggesting that hibernation results from a modification of existing traits shared by all mammals. However, until recently, the molecular mechanisms that give rise to hibernation were largely unknown.\nThe long-term goal of my laboratory is to understand and to harness nature's ingenious adaptations to enable induction of hibernation in non-hibernating mammals, including humans.

This talk will describe some of the technical developments of ultra-high magnetic field, specialized gradients, novel rf detectors and creative signal processing that have allowed us to achieve spatial resolution more than 2 million times that of clinical MRI. The methods have been translated from laboratory curiosity to routine practice providing new insights into a range of mouse models of disease. We will include applications in mouse models of normal aging and Alzheimer's disease. \n\nDr. G. Allan (Al) Johnson completed his BA in mathematics and physics at St. Olaf College, Northfield Minnesota in 1969. He completed his Ph.D. in physics at Duke University in 1974 and joined the department of radiology at Duke that same year. He served as the first Director of Diagnostic Physics for Duke Medical Center from 1979-2009. During that period, he had the good fortune to work in close collaboration with colleagues at GE Medical Systems in installing the world's first high field (1.5T) clinical MRI at Duke in 1983. Much of the early work was performed on dogs. A desire to limit studies on dogs lead Dr Johnson to ask how might MRI systems be adapted to higher spatial resolution (for mice and rats). He demonstrated the first in vivo images of rats at microscopic resolution in 1986. That same year he established The Duke Center for In Vivo Microscopy, an NIH National Resource dedicated to further the development and application of MR microscopy. He and his colleagues at the CIVM have continued to push the spatial resolution of MRI through development of specialized high field (9.4T) systems with high- performance gradients and RF coils and novel methods of encoding. Many of the advances are consequences of extensive collaboration with colleagues at Berkley, Stanford, University of Pennsylvania, Pittsburgh University, NIEHS and elsewhere. He is a Senior Fellow of the Society of Magnetic Resonance in Medicine and the Academy of Radiology. He is the Charles E.

Binary Heaps\nI will present the heap data structure. Two properties define a heap. First, it is a complete binary tree, so it is implemented using the array representation for complete binary trees. Second, the values stored in a heap are partially ordered. This means that there is a relationship between the value stored at any node and the values of its children. Due to its space and time efficiency, the heap is a popular choice for implementing a priority queue. \n\n2. AP CS A Outreach program \nI will present the outreach program between Penn Engineering and the non-profit Heights Phila I am coordinating. The program's goals are: (1) to expand CS access \u0026 excellence across Philadelphia and (2) to prepare students for the AP CS A exam. The program runs year-long, with in-person and online instruction during the school year and in-person during the summer. Since its inception, the number of students enrolled has more than doubled, and more than 75% of the students who took the AP CS A exam passed with a score of 3 or above). I will also discuss future outreach, teaching, and research ideas and what makes Duke University a great place to implement those projects. \n\nSPEAKER BIO \nDr. Eric Fouh is an Assistant Practice Professor of Computer Science at the University of Pennsylvania, where he teaches a variety of introductory and advanced courses.

When these degrees of freedom are entangled through a relativistic spin-orbit-coupling, quantum fluctuations can be enhanced, engendering diverse quantum phases of matter. The most celebrated example is the Kitaev quantum spin liquid for j=1/2 Kramers doublets on the honeycomb lattice. However, spin-orbital fluctuations can lead to many other possibilities, including multi-polar order, and spin orbitals liquids. In this talk, I will discuss specific examples of spin and orbital dynamics of two model face centered cubic antiferromagnets: GaTa4Se8, that realizes an orbitally active j=3/2 model; and K2IrCl6 that realizes a j=½ antiferromagnet.  GaTa4Se8 is a cluster Mott insulating lacunar spinel, where electrons occupy molecular orbitals that retain spin and orbital angular momentum. I will discuss neutron scattering measurements on this material that reveal a dynamical spin-orbital state preceding an order-disorder type spin-orbital ordering transition. Spin-orbit coupling overcomes the Jahn-Teller mechanism in GaTa4Se8 and results in a novel spin-orbital valence bond ground state. K2IrCl6 is a highly frustrated antiferromagnet with dominant Heisenberg and Kitaev interactions. I will present inelastic neutron scattering measurements on this compound that show a striking dichotomy of the static and dynamic correlations. Static correlations resemble a classically ordered state, but the dynamic correlations reveal a dominance of quantum fluctuations and a quantum order-by-disorder mechanism. These results showcase the power of neutron scattering to reveal spin and orbital dynamics in quantum materials.","status":"CONFIRMED","sponsor":"Physics","co_sponsors":null,"location":{"address":"None"},"contact":{"name":"Frazier.

We introduce a novel empirical test of standard neoclassical models of fertility that directly tests the prediction of opposite-signed income and intertemporal substitution effects of business cycles by examining the interaction of the aggregate unemployment rate with a measure of potential income replacement from UI. Our results show that as UI benefit generosity reaches 100 percent income replacement, there is no effect of the unemployment rate on births. This implies that the well-documented cyclical nature of births is about access to liquidity. We also provide novel evidence that infant health is countercyclical based on timing of conception, but procyclical based on time in utero. The negative relationship between the in utero aggregate unemployment rate and infant health also disappears when potential UI replacement rates reach 100 percent. Our results imply that the social insurance provided by UI has a pro-natalist effect and improves the health and economic well-being of the next generation.","status":"CONFIRMED","sponsor":"Duke Population Research Institute (DuPRI)","co_sponsors":["Social Science Research Institute (SSRI)"],"location":{"address":"SSRI-Gross Hall 270","link":"https://maps.duke.edu/?focus=203"},"contact":{"name":"None"},"categories":["Social Sciences","Lecture/Talk","Panel/Seminar/Colloquium","Research"],"link":"https://calendar.duke.edu/show?fq=id:CAL-8a03932d-8a96243a-018b-1e85d902-00000433demobedework@mysite.edu","event_url":"https://dupri.duke.edu/news-events/events/melissa-kearney-professor-economics-university-maryland-presents-cyclicality","submitted_by":["my109"],"series-name":"DUPRI Seminar Series","presenter":"Melissa Kearney - University of Maryland"},{"id":"CAL-8a03932d-8a96243a-018a-ae92dfce-00000a50demobedework@mysite.edu","start_timestamp":"2023-11-02T16:00:00Z","end_timestamp":"2023-11-02T17:15:00Z","summary":"CCDGB: Bayo Akomolafe, \"Becoming-black: On white syncopation at the end of the world\"","description":"Please join the Climate Change, Decolonization, and Global Blackness Lab (CCDGB) at the John Hope Franklin Humanities Institute for our 2023-24 speaker series. CCDGB is part of The Entanglement Project, an FHI initiative focused on the intersections of race, health, and climate.\n\nABOUT THE SPEAKER: Bayo Akomolafe, Ph.D., is a widely celebrated international speaker, posthumanist thinker, poet, teacher, public intellectual, essayist, and author of two books, /These Wilds Beyond our Fences: Letters to My Daughter on Humanity's Search for Home/ and /We Will Tell our Own Story: The Lions of Africa Speak/. He is the Founder of The Emergence Network and host of the postactivist course/festival/event, 'We Will Dance with Mountains'. He currently lectures at Pacifica Graduate Institute, California. He sits on the Board of many organizations including Science and Non-Duality (US) and Ancient Futures (Australia). In July 2022, Dr. Akomolafe was appointed the inaugural Global Senior Fellow of UC Berkeley's Othering and Belonging Institute. He has also been Fellow for The New Institute in Hamburg, Germany, and Visiting Critic-in-Residence for the Otis College of Art and Design, Los Angeles (2023). He is the recipient of an Honorary Doctorate from the California Institute of Integral Studies (CIIS), among other recognitions.\n\nABOUT THE LECTURE: The Yorubas have a proverb: \"In order to find your way, you must lose it.\" In this talk, Dr. Bayo Akomolafe draws from the transatlantic excursions of the Yoruba deities known as orishas and the concept of 'ase' to reframe blackness as a more-than-human, counterhegemonic flow of indeterminacy that \"maddens the imperial individual\" and teases apart the project of stability from an \"external within.\" This coming-apart is white syncopation, also known as becoming-black. \"Not a becoming 'Black', but a becoming 'black'. A becoming-monster. A losing one's way. A veering off-course. A becoming-imperceptible....[which] is not necessarily about building new institutions, winning legislative victories, receiving reparations, or gaining greater representation and visibility.\" Akomolafe suggests that this becoming-black is the condition for the emergence of an autistic politics that cradles 'the minor gesture' (Erin Manning) as a response to contemporary crises.\n\nIN-PERSON REGISTRATION: https://duke.is/yc4gm\nZOOM REGISTRATION: https://duke.is/c/tjhj","status":"CONFIRMED","sponsor":"Franklin Humanities Institute (FHI)","co_sponsors":null,"location":{"address":"None"},"contact":{"name":"Franklin Humanities Institute","email":"fhi@duke.edu"},"categories":["Climate","Sustainability","Africa focus","Global","Humanities","Lecture/Talk"],"link":"https://calendar.duke.edu/show?fq=id:CAL-8a03932d-8a96243a-018a-ae92dfce-00000a50demobedework@mysite.edu","event_url":null,"submitted_by":["cmc7"],"webcast-url":"https://duke.is/yc4gm","series-name":"Climate Change, Decolonization \u0026 Global Blackness","presenter":"Bayo Akomolafe","image":"https://calendar.duke.edu/images//2023/20231102/9857dea25e83ebf6240039341542b3ff-CR-CCDGB square w Entanglement Proj_20230919055255PM.png","image_alt_text":"Climate Change, Decolonization \u0026amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp; Global Blackness logo"},{"id":"CAL-8a028ad1-899cba17-018a-04bff167-00007ae7demobedework@mysite.edu","start_timestamp":"2023-11-02T16:30:00Z","end_timestamp":"2023-11-02T17:30:00Z","summary":"Thursday Seminar Series","description":"Elda Grabocka, Ph.D., Thomas Jefferson University\nHost: Stefano Di Talia","status":"CONFIRMED","sponsor":"Molecular Genetics and Microbiology (MGM)","co_sponsors":["Cell Biology","Program in Cell and Molecular Biology","School of Medicine (SOM)"],"location":{"address":"Nanaline Duke 147","link":"https://maps.duke.edu/?focus=69"},"contact":{"name":"Kennett, Annette","email":"annette.kennett@duke.edu","phone":"919-613-8636"},"categories":["Lecture/Talk"],"link":"https://calendar.duke.edu/show?fq=id:CAL-8a028ad1-899cba17-018a-04bff167-00007ae7demobedework@mysite.edu","event_url":null,"submitted_by":["kenne031"],"series-name":"Thursday Seminer Series","presenter":"Elda Grabocka, Ph.D."},{"id":"CAL-8a018cb3-8855248a-0189-97bda488-00001161demobedework@mysite.edu_20231102T170000Z","start_timestamp":"2023-11-02T17:00:00Z","end_timestamp":"2023-11-02T19:00:00Z","summary":"Academic Advising Center Drop-in Advising","description":"Drop by the AAC with quick advising questions or to get additional input on your academic plans.","status":"CONFIRMED","sponsor":"Academic Advising Center (AAC)","co_sponsors":null,"location":{"address":"Academic Advising Center","link":"https://maps.duke.edu/?focus=172"},"contact":{"name":"Hoff, Jen","email":"jen.hoff@duke.edu","phone":"919-681-2054"},"categories":["Student"],"link":"https://calendar.duke.edu/show?fq=id:CAL-8a018cb3-8855248a-0189-97bda488-00001161demobedework@mysite.edu_20231102T170000Z","event_url":null,"submitted_by":["jdh106"],"webcast-url":"https://advising.duke.edu/"},{"id":"CAL-8a03932d-8a96243a-018a-a4e85da8-000071ffdemobedework@mysite.edu_20231102T170000Z","start_timestamp":"2023-11-02T17:00:00Z","end_timestamp":"2023-11-02T17:45:00Z","summary":"Organ Demonstration","description":"This organ demonstration is an opportunity to stop in to hear a Duke Chapel organ or Bösendorfer grand piano played in the informal atmosphere of an open rehearsal.

Orphaned and estranged, the Syriani children raised themselves while they lived with hate, anger and confusion as the man they could only refer to as \"Him Him\" lived on death row.

Yet, for all its familiarity, Beethoven's music is enigmatic and full of contradictions. This program, featuring two works for violin and piano, shows his contrasts in spirit, as the relatively brief and serenely beautiful \"Romance in F\" stands opposite the epic \"Kreutzer\" sonata, a large, tense work of great virtuosity and emotional depth. Paired as a modern foil on this program is American composer Daniel Temkin. His colorful trio \"Maksimal\" for violin, piano, and percussion reflects and illuminates particular elements of Beethoven's own sensibility, as short motivic cells, fiery rhythms, poignant melodies, and bold textural shifts coalesce to form large-scale architectures and sound worlds. Heard together, these pieces reveal emotional depths and a sense of musical organicism that speaks across time, genres, and place. \n\nNoted individually for their brilliant artistry and musical creativity, violinist Ariana Kim and pianist Ieva Jokubaviciute have performed together as a duo for over a decade. Appearing together in concerts, teaching residencies, and festivals, the duo has also commissioned and recorded numerous works together. Originally\nexisting as a violin concerto, \"Maksimal\" was arranged for the duo in 2019. \n\nCo-Artistic Director of both Chamber Music Society of Minnesota and the Paesaggi Musicali Toscani Festival in Italy, violinist Ariana Kim performs around the world as a soloist and chamber artist. She is a professor at Cornell University. \n\nA professor at Duke University, Ieva Jokubaviciute is veteran artist of Marlboro, Ravinia, Kneisel Hall, and other top festivals. She is a Naumburg Chamber Music laureate and recipient of the prestigious Borletti-Buitoni Fellowship. \n\nAn award-winning composer, Daniel Temkin's music has been heard worldwide at the Intimacy of Creativity Festival, Dresden Music Festival, Bath Festival, Banff Centre, and many others. As a percussionist, he has played with the Orchestra of St. Luke's Chamber Ensemble, the Riverside Choral society, and the International Contemporary Ensemble (ICE), among others.","status":"CONFIRMED","sponsor":"Music","co_sponsors":null,"location":{"address":"East Duke 201 - Nelson Music Room","link":"https://maps.duke.edu/?focus=157"},"contact":{"name":"Duke Music","email":"duke-music@duke.edu"},"categories":["Concert/Music"],"link":"https://calendar.duke.edu/show?fq=id:CAL-8a02906b-8a0a73d8-018a-22a4ea22-00000a98demobedework@mysite.edu","event_url":"https://music.duke.edu","submitted_by":["ethomps"],"image":"https://calendar.duke.edu/images//2023/20231102/d0b2b109dacbe3e9b1f092ec22de3ab3-CR-Kim_Joku_Temkin_20230823014547PM.jpg","image_alt_text":"Headshots of Ariana Kim, Ieva Jokubaviciute, and Daniel Temkin"},{"id":"CAL-2c918083-7bf1eaed-017c-150f18e4-0000595cdemobedework@mysite.edu_20231103T040000Z","start_timestamp":"2023-11-03T04:00:00Z","end_timestamp":"2024-08-02T04:00:00Z","summary":"Doing Good Employee Giving Campaign","description":"Doing Good, Duke's annual employee giving campaign, encourages Duke employees to donate to five community-identified need categories, including the United Way of the Greater Triangle.

Breakfast is served at 9 am and the lecture begins promptly at 9:30 am.\n\nElectric Voice: Tactility and Tacticality in Revolutionary Iran -\n\nThe economic boycott of Nokia phones by Iranian protestors in the summer of 2009 marks one historical instance of their vanguardist tactics in relation the economies of a global medium. The boycott was an early tactical measure that was directly linked to the tactility and sensorial closeness of lightweight digital devices as the people attempted to reclaim their democratic rights and civil liberties in Iran after a fraudulent election. Though largely dismissed at the time, the Nokia boycott had the potential to draw the attention of a watchful global collective towards the huge collection of data underway -- data that would be used to advance machine learning in years that followed. Right there, in the electrifying rage of that moment's digital collectivity and expansive freedom, lay the evolutionary beginnings of an algorithmic logic that would come to strangle the electric voice by bolstering online platforms for maximum capital gain. The presentation considers the transformation of global media in relation to the voices of a people in revolt.\n\nSpeaker Bio:\n\nNegar Mottahedeh teaches media studies in the Program in Literature at Duke University. Her research on film, social media, and social movements in the Middle East has been published by Stanford University Press, Syracuse University Press, Duke University Press and in WIRED magazine,The Hill, Salon.com, The Observer and The Wall Street Journal.

AERPAW supports large-scale outdoor advanced wireless experiments with autonomous unmanned aerial and ground vehicles (UAVs/UGVs) and it is remotely accessible by the nationwide research community. Users of AERPAW have the opportunity to design and rapidly prototype next-generation wireless technologies, systems, and applications in both emulated and real-world environments. This talk will review the overall scope, and existing outdoor infrastructure including eight dedicated fixed nodes (towers, rooftop nodes, and a light pole) and their capabilities, as well as future plans for the AERPAW project. We will describe various different experiment examples involving software-defined radios, a commercial Ericsson 4G/5G network, RF sensors from Keysight, and a smart agriculture system with various LoRa gateways and sensors, all of them interacting with autonomous UAVs and UGVs in a large-scale outdoor environment. We will overview our digital twin that allows AERPAW users to exclusively design their outdoor experiments in a containerized virtual environment. We will also provide various research examples carried out on the platform since AERPAW declared general availability in November 2021.","status":"CONFIRMED","sponsor":"Electrical and Computer Engineering (ECE)","co_sponsors":null,"location":{"address":"Hudson Hall 125","link":"https://maps.duke.edu/?focus=101"},"contact":{"name":"Rice, Cynthia","email":"cynthia.rice@duke.edu","phone":"919-660-5252"},"categories":["Engineering","Panel/Seminar/Colloquium","Conference/Symposium"],"link":"https://calendar.duke.edu/show?fq=id:CAL-8a03932d-8a96243a-018a-a9a87308-00003c45demobedework@mysite.edu","event_url":null,"submitted_by":["cpr24"],"presenter":"Ismail Guvenc","image":"https://calendar.duke.edu/images//2023/20231103/20030f01a4e6d9fa5463e07a3f647f20-CR-ISMAIL GUVENC_20230919081459PM.jpg","image_alt_text":"ISMAIL GUVENC"},{"id":"CAL-8a03932d-8a96243a-018b-165e68ab-000031d2demobedework@mysite.edu","start_timestamp":"2023-11-03T19:00:00Z","end_timestamp":"2023-11-03T20:30:00Z","summary":"BME Virtual Open House","description":"Join Duke Biomedical Engineering at our Virtual Open House.

As he acclimates to the new job, Haider becomes infatuated with the strong-willed trans woman Biba who runs the show-an unforeseen partnership that opens his eyes and ultimately his worldview, in ways both unexpected and intimate.\n\n\"An aching consideration of gender and sexuality.\" - Lovia Gyarkye, The Hollywood Reporter\n\n\"Brims with physical and emotional energy.\" - Siddhant Adlakha, Indiewire","status":"CONFIRMED","sponsor":"Cinematic Arts","co_sponsors":null,"location":{"address":"Rubenstein Arts Center, Film Theater","link":"https://maps.duke.edu/?focus=351"},"contact":{"name":"Okazaki, Hank","email":"hokazak@duke.edu"},"categories":["Asia focus","Movie/Film"],"link":"https://calendar.duke.edu/show?fq=id:CAL-8a018d0d-8b5366bc-018b-5e564bd1-00005be2demobedework@mysite.edu","event_url":"https://cinematicarts.duke.edu/screensociety/screenings/joyland-saim-sadiq-2022","submitted_by":["sab141"],"presenter":"Introduced by Shiraz Ahmed (MFA in Experimental \u0026 Documentary Arts)","image":"https://calendar.duke.edu/images//2023/20231103/d949a259233194a4f3f60d00418326f0-CR-Joyland-Still-2-2048x1152_20231023085955PM.png","image_alt_text":"Still from Joyland"},{"id":"CAL-8a02906b-8a0a73d8-018a-8a73e478-00003a80demobedework@mysite.edu","start_timestamp":"2023-11-03T23:00:00Z","end_timestamp":"2023-11-04T00:00:00Z","summary":"Hungry for Change: Ending Food Waste","description":"Join us during Duke's Family Weekend to hear from Jasmine Crowe-Houston, social entrepreneur, TED speaker, and founder and CEO of Goodr!\n\nFrom 6-7pm there will be a reception at the Bryan Center's: The Landing, followed by a keynote and moderated Q\u0026A in Reynold's Theater from 7-8pm where Jasmine will explain how she built a tech company to solve two of the world's biggest problems: hunger and food waste.

Brown, director, and Evan Roberson, associate director, as they welcome saxophonist Gregory Tardy and Derrick Gardner to the Baldwin stage for this special Family Weekend concert that kicks off a season celebrating John Brown's 20th year as Director of the Jazz Program at Duke. \n\n$10 general admission/free for students. Tickets: https://tickets.duke.edu.\n\n\"Big sound, deep seated feel for the blues, and cerebral avante-garde chops,\" is how New York Magazine describes saxophonist, multi-reedist, and composer Gregory Tardy. Tardy is one of the most versatile jazz musicians of his generation, equally comfortable in a variety of musical and improvisational situations. In 1992, he started playing with legendary drummer Elvin Jones, and he recorded his first CD, \"Crazy Love.\" Tardy has played with many prominent jazz artists including Wynton Marsalis, Jay McShann, Nicholas Payton, Roy Hargrove, Steve Coleman, Betty Carter, Don Byron, Bill Frisell, Rashied Ali, Ellis Marsalis, Brian Lynch and John Patitucci, among others. His performances have taken him around the world, playing at all of the major jazz festivals and on some of the biggest stages in jazz. As a sideman, he has been featured on several Downbeat Albums of the Year and also several Grammy nominated recordings; including a Grammy winning CD with Brian Lynch in 2006. He also has recorded fourteen CDs under his own name featuring his unique compositions, blending his love of traditional jazz with a more modern seeking style. His latest project, \"If Time Could Stand Still,\" was released in the fall of 2020 on WJ3 Records. \n\nJazz trumpeter Derrick Gardner is inspired by the finest hard-blowing funky bop bands of the 1960's. Gardner quickly made his mark when he arrived on the New York jazz scene in 1991. There he began an illustrious career that has taken him around the world performing internationally with the Count Basie Orchestra, (1991-present), Frank Foster's Loud Minority Band, Harry Connick Jr.'s Big Band, The Smithsonian Jazz Masterworks Orchestra and Swiss tenor player Roman Schwaller's European Sextet. Over the last 29 years, he has worked with artists such as Dizzy Gillespie, George Benson, Frank Foster, Jon Faddis, Nancy Wilson and Tony Bennett. He formed his own sextet, The Jazz Prophets, in 1991; it continues to be one of the primary vehicles for his distinctive, hard-driving music.","status":"CONFIRMED","sponsor":"Music","co_sponsors":null,"location":{"address":"Baldwin Auditorium","link":"https://maps.duke.edu/?focus=291"},"contact":{"name":"Duke University Box Office","email":"tickets@duke.edu"},"categories":["Concert/Music","Parents' and Family Weekend"],"link":"https://calendar.duke.edu/show?fq=id:CAL-8a02906b-8a0a73d8-018a-22bb8959-00000b9edemobedework@mysite.edu","event_url":"https://tickets.duke.edu","submitted_by":["ethomps"],"image":"https://calendar.duke.edu/images//2023/20231103/3e458c3d300b8b279e8de543eaca1197-CR-Tardy_and_Gardner_web_20231009092341PM.jpg","image_alt_text":"Gregory Tardy standing against a glass wall with his reflection mirrored in it, and a headshot of Derrick Gardner holding his trumpet."},{"id":"CAL-8a02906b-8a0a73d8-018a-846f3d55-00004508demobedework@mysite.edu","start_timestamp":"2023-11-04T03:55:00Z","end_timestamp":"2023-11-04T04:00:00Z","summary":" Apply now!
